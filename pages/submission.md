## Paper Submission & Review Policy
Authors are advised to submit their original and unpublished work (related to the conference theme).

The review process takes into account both the quality of writing and the scientific impact of the work. Authors should clearly identify the problem, explain their contribution(s), and justify the state-of-the-art works. The program committee would like to review those who develop, argue, and provide results.

Also, note that the (ICSGET) team takes care of plagiarism (even self-plagiarism) as serious professional misconduct. All papers will be screened for plagiarism, and the (ICSGET) team will reject them in case there exists significant overlap with the previously published papers/papers.

## Submission Guidelines

The paper should present results in a clear and structured manner using appropriate figures, tables, and discussions, followed by meaningful conclusions that highlight key insights, implications, and possible directions for future work.
